//Mini Challenges 5 to 7
//I recreated the mini challenges 5 to 7 from the combine with endpoints
//Peer reviewer: Halley Pham
//Peer review: When I tried to run, it didn't work because there were errors on IBSevenServices and ISevenServices, where there wasn't a semicolon. If you put those, the endpoints work as intended except for Mini Challenge 5. I think it might be because in Swagger, it says that verb3 and verb4 aren't required so there may be some inconsistencies in the parameters and inside your Madlib. Overall Good job!
